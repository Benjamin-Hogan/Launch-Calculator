# Setup Guide

This guide walks you through preparing a Raspberry Pi Zero W and installing **Launch Calculator** from scratch. No prior environment is assumed.

## 1. Prepare the Raspberry Pi

1. Download the latest **Raspberry Pi OS Lite** image from the official website.
2. Flash the image to a microSD card using **Raspberry Pi Imager** or `dd` on Linux/Mac.
3. (Optional) To enable headless access, create an empty file named `ssh` in the boot partition and add a `wpa_supplicant.conf` file with your Wiâ€‘Fi credentials.
4. Insert the card into the Pi Zero W and power it on.

## 2. First Boot Configuration

1. Connect to the Pi via SSH or a keyboard and monitor.
2. Run the initial update and install required packages:
   ```bash
   sudo apt update && sudo apt upgrade -y
   sudo apt install openjdk-11-jdk maven nodejs npm git -y
   ```
3. Verify the installations:
   ```bash
   java -version   # should print an OpenJDK 11 version
   mvn -version    # should print the Maven version
   node -v         # should print the Node.js version
   ```

## 3. Clone the Repository

1. Choose a directory (e.g. `/home/pi`) and clone the project:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/youruser/launch-calculator.git
   cd launch-calculator
   ```

## 4. Build the Backend

While online, download dependencies and package the application:
```bash
cd backend
mvn dependency:go-offline      # fetch Maven dependencies once
mvn -o clean package           # build using the cached dependencies
```

The compiled JAR will appear under `backend/target/`.

## 5. Build the Frontend

```bash
cd ../frontend
npm install              # install Node modules
npm run build            # create production bundle
cp -r dist/* ../backend/src/main/resources/static/
```

This copies the built web assets so the Spring Boot app can serve them.

## 6. Test the Application

Start the backend on the Pi:
```bash
cd ../backend
java -Xmx256m -jar target/launch-calculator-0.1.jar
```

Browse to `http://<pi-address>:8080` from another device on the network. You should see the application UI.

## 7. Updating TLE Data

When you have internet connectivity, run the provided script to refresh satellite data:
```bash
./scripts/update-tle.sh
```

You are now ready to deploy the application permanently. See `docs/deploy.md` for details on running Launch Calculator as a service.
